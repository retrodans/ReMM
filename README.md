# ToDo

## Phase 1
* Test using the local cron

## Phase 2
* Get it running on my server on cron
* Delete the git history as much as possible (probably start a new repo tbh)
* Finally commit to GitHub

## Phase 4
* Look at code improvements and housekeeping

## Phase 5
* Architect a UX for this to act on a freemium SaaS model
** Limit targets?
** Limit sources per target group?
** Work out how to add items to settings file using the UX (but securely)
** Consider performance of files being read (SQLite instead?)
** Add in collection capabilities aswell
